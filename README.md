To Arlette and Gisele

I would like to _be_(.)	not here, but this border layer of the ether: where ground, ceiling, left and right meet but never touch. For I envisage the serene anxiety and the deafening silence of a land without land nor temporality (;) to apprehend the fractures of continua that leave their immediate past and features to die(,) in the abruptness with which I am teared away from them. 


This monument crystallises a geographical and topographical constant to situate visceral experiences and spontaneous motor relationships within our bodies. It is a landmark to the hyper-sensitivity of the imperception, acting as an incentive to regain or take consciousness of our environment, our body and act to redefine our interpersonal relationships. For the narrative we choose to own or fabricate is intimately shaped by the conditions of the space we inhabit. 

The focus of my attention had been to meet the Sun at the horizon. While I stumbled on the disappointing inability to reach him, this logged heliotrope itinerary through the streets of Glasgow was filling the intrinsically volatile leap of the ether by materialising a silver lining within the architecture, within the city itself, separating light and shade by giving its outline with my body. For each road intersection walked by, a unique three-word-identifier was collected with the help of the geocode application what3words, each representing a physical square of 3m2 with a tangible spatial coordinate. Each grouping of words was paired to three distinct voices, as though three people were walking down the streets. Each change of cardinal direction rearranged the order of words in the (person’s) voice they were attributed. Quiet Sand Suffer provides a ‘diacritical’ reading of the particular and intrinsically fluid spatiotemporal outlines of this other (u)topia it informs. This three-part poem computationally worded appears as a prayer to the pulling force(s), an ode to the sun, tinted of computational naturalism 

Literal etched pathways of (homo)heliotrope movements, this heterotopia solely exists as a by-product of its performative, computational and poetic layering, offering new approaches and instances to apprehend the geographic-volume, the corporal-humanist and the material-plastic.
